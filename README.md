<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## 🌀 About

Aero is an advanced discord bot that is capable of playing high quality music. Aero has advanced music filters and commands which makes the user’s listening experience clear and enjoyable. Aero uses slash commands, however, users who do not want to use slash commands can also use the “a/“ prefix. Commands include search, loop, pause, play, and nowplaying and much more. To see the full list of commands users are able to use the “help” command. Using the 247 command, users (specifically the owners or admins of the server) are able to allow the bot to stay in any Voice Channel 24/7. Aero is still growing and more fun commands are being developed for the bot to be even more enjoyable for it’s users.
